# Decision Log

A reverse-chronological journal of architectural and strategic decisions.
Maintained by AI coding agents (and human developers) at the end of working
sessions. Each entry captures what was decided, what alternatives were
considered, and why — so future contributors never revisit dead ends or lose
context on trade-offs already evaluated.

Agents: read this file before working on any module referenced here.

### When to log

Log decisions that constrain future design, involved genuine alternatives,
or would be non-obvious to a future contributor. A good litmus test: does
the "What this rules out" section have something meaningful to say?

Do NOT log: bug fixes with obvious solutions, test-only refactors,
documentation updates, or minor config tweaks that don't affect
architecture.

### Entry format

Insert new entries directly below this header, newest first. Do not modify
or reorder existing entries except to add supersession notes (see below).
If a session produced multiple independent decisions, create a separate
entry for each.

**Year-end summaries:** When the log rolls into a new calendar year, add
a summary entry titled "Summary of [previous year] decisions" that
briefly describes each decision from that year in one line. This gives
agents scanning forward a checkpoint before older entries.

```
---

## YYYY-MM-DD — [Short descriptive title]

**Trigger**: What problem, requirement, or situation prompted this work.

**Options explored**:
- For each option, name the approach, its strengths, and why it was or
  wasn't chosen. Include options that were tried and reverted.

**Decision**: What was chosen and the core trade-off.

**What this rules out**: Future directions now constrained or foreclosed.
What would trigger revisiting this decision.

**Relevant files**: Key files created or modified.
```

### Guidelines

- Focus on **why**, not what. The diff shows what changed; this log
  explains the reasoning.
- Capture rejected alternatives with equal care. Future agents need to
  know what was already tried.
- Be specific — name libraries, files, config choices, error messages.
- Aim for 10–50 lines per entry. Reference document, not narrative.
- Plain language. No jargon, no editorializing, no padding.

### Superseded entries

When a new decision invalidates, corrects, or replaces guidance in an older
entry, add a blockquote annotation to the affected older entry — do not
rewrite or delete its original text. Place the note immediately after the
entry's heading or after the paragraph containing the superseded claim.

> **⚠ Superseded** (YYYY-MM-DD): [Brief explanation of what changed and
> why.] See "[title of newer entry]" above.

Use **⚠ Partially superseded** when only specific claims are affected, and
**⚠ Superseded** when the entire entry's premise or decision has been
overturned. Always scan older entries for claims that conflict with the new
decision — agents reading the log linearly will otherwise encounter
contradictory guidance.

## 2026-03-10 — Source file extension migration from .bas to descriptive extensions

**Trigger**: The `.bas` extension was overloaded across five distinct content types: VBA standard modules (actual VBA code), forms, reports, queries, and macros (all Access `SaveAsText` proprietary format). This confused editors applying VBA syntax highlighting to non-VBA files, made it harder to distinguish file types at a glance, and conflicted with the legitimate `.bas` usage for VBA modules.

**Options explored**:

- **Per-type descriptive extensions** (`.form`, `.report`, `.macro`, `.qdef`): Full-word, unambiguous, zero collision with known formats. Parallels modern conventions (`.proto`, `.graphql`). Chosen.
- **Single unified extension** (`.axt` or `.sat` for all SaveAsText output): Simple to document, but loses per-file type distinction and relies entirely on subfolder names. Rejected as less intuitive.
- **Abbreviated extensions** (`.frm`, `.rpt`, `.mac`, `.qry`): Familiar feel, but `.frm` directly conflicts with VBE forms (`clsDbVbeForm` already uses `.frm`), `.rpt` is associated with Crystal Reports, `.mac` with macOS resource forks. Rejected due to collisions.

**Decision**: Forms use `.form`, reports use `.report`, queries use `.qdef` ("query definition" — distinguishes from the companion `.sql` file), macros use `.macro`. VBA modules keep `.bas`/`.cls` unchanged. Gated behind `EFV_5_0_0` (not a new version, since 5.0.0 hasn't shipped yet). Import methods accept both old `.bas` and new extensions for backward compatibility. Export, `GetFileList`, `FileExtensions`, and `SourceFile` use only the new extensions.

Fixed a latent bug in `clsDbQuery.Import`: two `Left$(strFile, Len(strFile) - 4)` calls hardcoded the `.bas` extension length (4 chars). With `.qdef` (5 chars) this would produce wrong paths. Replaced with `SwapExtension(strFile, "sql")`.

**What this rules out**: The `.bas` extension is no longer used for forms, reports, queries, or macros in export format >= 5.0.0. Adding new SaveAsText-based component types should follow this pattern of descriptive extensions. The abbreviations `.frm`, `.rpt`, `.mac`, `.qry` are ruled out — revisit only if a compelling external standard emerges. If a future component type's natural extension collides with an existing format, prefer full words.

- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbReport.cls` — `.report` extension

## 2026-03-10 — Extension migration strategy: FSO.MoveFile + index key rename

**Trigger**: When upgrading from old `.bas` extensions to new descriptive extensions, existing source files need to be renamed. For git repos, history preservation during the rename is desirable. The add-in already had `SplitFilesWithHistory` (branch-and-merge pattern) for splitting form layout from VBA code.

**Options explored**:

- **Reuse `SplitFilesWithHistory` branch-and-merge pattern**: Creates a temp branch, moves files, commits, restores originals, merges with `--no-ff`. Designed to produce two files that both have history. Overkill for a pure rename where the original should disappear. Rejected.
- **Add `git mv` command to `clsGitIntegration`**: Would stage renames atomically. But `RunGitCommand` is private, adding a new enum value requires modifying the class, and iterating hundreds of files one-at-a-time with shell calls is slow. Rejected as over-engineered.
- **`FSO.MoveFile` for all cases + index key rename**: Simple file rename, works with or without git. Git detects renames on commit via content similarity (100% match for identical content). Combined with renaming VCS index dictionary keys to prevent a full re-export. Chosen.

**Decision**: `MigrateFileExtensions` in `modImportExport.bas` runs on every export when `ExportFormatVersion >= EFV_5_0_0`. It scans each affected folder for old `.bas` files, renames them with `FSO.MoveFile`, then calls `VCSIndex.MigrateIndexExtension` to rename the corresponding dictionary keys. The `MigrateIndexExtension` method is generic and bidirectional — it takes a category name and target extension, iterates both `Components` and `AlternateExport` sections, and uses `Scripting.Dictionary.Key(old) = new` for in-place key rename. This supports reverting to `.bas` if a user drops back to a legacy export format version. `ClearFilesByExtension` calls in `UpgradeSourceFiles` serve as a safety net for any `.bas` stragglers missed by migration.

The index key rename was added specifically to avoid a costly full re-export on large projects. Without it, the stale `.bas` keys would cause the add-in to treat every form/report/query/macro as modified (no matching index entry), triggering `SaveAsText` for potentially hundreds of objects.

**What this rules out**: No git-specific commands are used for the migration — history preservation depends entirely on git's rename detection at commit time. This is reliable for identical content but could miss renames if the user also makes significant content changes in the same commit (similarity drops below git's 50% threshold). If this proves problematic, adding explicit `git mv` support to `clsGitIntegration` could be revisited. The `SplitFilesWithHistory` pattern remains available for future scenarios that genuinely need both files to retain history.

**Relevant files**:

- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/modImportExport.bas` — `MigrateFileExtensions`, `RenameFilesInFolder`, migration call in `ExportSource`
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsVCSIndex.cls` — `MigrateIndexExtension`

## 2026-03-10 — Per-category option hashing for smart re-export

> **⚠ Supersedes** the `OptionsHash` mechanism described in "Export format versioning system" below. `OptionsHash` (single string) is replaced by `CategoryHashes` (per-category dictionary) in `clsVCSIndex`.

**Trigger**: Changing any export option (e.g., adding a table to `TablesToExportData`, toggling `ShowDebug`, adjusting print settings) triggered a full export of ALL database objects. On large databases this takes 30+ minutes, even when only a single component category is affected by the change.

**Options explored**:

- **Blacklist non-export options from hash**: Remove options like `ShowDebug`, `MaxLogFiles`, etc. from `GetHash()`. Simple, but still forces full export of everything when any remaining option changes — e.g., changing `ExtractThemeFiles` would still re-export all forms, reports, and queries. Rejected as insufficient.
- **Whitelist export options with flat hash**: Only hash the ~13 export-affecting options. Reduces false triggers but doesn't solve the cross-category problem. Rejected as a half-measure.
- **Per-category option hashing**: Compute a separate hash for each component category based on only the options that affect it. Store per-category hashes in the index. During export, only categories whose hash changed get full re-export; others use fast save. Chosen.

**Decision**: Replaced `OptionsHash` (single string) with `CategoryHashes` (Dictionary mapping category names to hashes) in `clsVCSIndex`. New `GetCategoryHashes()` function on `clsOptions` uses a `Select Case` that classifies every option into the categories it affects. Each category's hash includes its specific options plus global options (`ExportFormatVersion`, major Access version). A `Debug.Print` guard in `Case Else` names any unclassified option when a developer adds a new option to `m_colOptions` without classifying it.

Options are classified as:
- **Category-specific**: e.g., `SaveQuerySQL` affects Queries; `ExtractThemeFiles` affects Themes
- **Multi-category**: `SanitizeLevel` and `StripPublishOption` affect Forms, Reports, Queries, Macros, Tables, and Table Data Macros
- **Global**: `ExportFormatVersion` and major Access version — changing these triggers full export of all categories
- **Non-export**: 20 options (`ShowDebug`, `UseFastSave`, `TablesToExportData`, hooks, etc.) that don't affect exported file content and are excluded from all hashes

`TablesToExportData` is excluded because `clsDbTableData.IsModified` always returns `True` — table data is always exported regardless of fast save mode.

In `ExportSource()`, global hash changes set `blnFullExport = True` (same as user checking the Full Export box). Category-level changes build a `dStaleCategories` dictionary; the category loop checks `blnFullExport Or dStaleCategories.Exists(cCategory.Category)` per iteration.

**What this rules out**: The old `OptionsHash` string property on `clsVCSIndex` is removed. Old index files without `CategoryHashes` produce empty stored hashes, causing all categories to be treated as stale on first run (equivalent to the old full-export behavior). `GetHash()` still exists for backward compatibility, derived from `GetCategoryHashes()`. Future options must be added to the `Select Case` in `GetCategoryHashes()` — the `Debug.Print` guard catches omissions during development. When adding a new option that affects export output, add it to the appropriate category case(s); when adding a non-export option, add it to the skip case.

**Relevant files**:

- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsOptions.cls` — `GetCategoryHashes()`, `AddToCat()`, simplified `GetHash()`
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsVCSIndex.cls` — `CategoryHashes` property, removed `OptionsHash`
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/modImportExport.bas` — per-category stale detection in `ExportSource()`
- `Version Control.accda.src/forms/frmVCSMain.cls` — only force full export on global hash change

## 2026-03-06 — Export format versioning system

> **⚠ Partially superseded** (2026-03-10): The file extension migration was folded into `EFV_5_0_0` rather than adding a new `EFV_5_1_0`, since 5.0.0 has not shipped yet. The general pattern (add enum member, update `[_Last]`, gate with `>=`) remains correct for future post-release changes. See "Source file extension migration from .bas to descriptive extensions" above.

**Trigger**: When users updated the add-in, export format changes (sanitization adjustments, structural tweaks to forms/reports/command bars) would produce hundreds of source file diffs unrelated to the user's actual work. Users couldn't distinguish their five real changes from hundreds of format-upgrade changes, especially mid-feature when the working tree was dirty.

**Options explored**:

- **String-based version constants with helper function**: Constants like `EFV_NORMALIZE_FORM_VIEWPORT = "5.0.0"` with a `ExportFormatAtLeast(strMinVersion)` helper that builds padded comparison strings. Clear and self-documenting per feature, but slower (string comparison at every gate point) and adds an unnecessary helper function. Rejected in favor of enums.
- **Feature-flag booleans derived from format version**: A module that sets `m_blnNormalizeViewport = True` etc. based on the selected version. Single definition point, but adds indirection and a parallel set of variables to maintain. Rejected as over-engineered.
- **Packed-integer enum with native comparison**: `eExportFormatVersion` enum using `Major * 10000 + Minor * 100 + Patch` (e.g., `EFV_4_1_2 = 40102`, `EFV_5_0_0 = 50000`). Gate points use native `>=` comparison: `If Options.ExportFormatVersion >= EFV_5_0_0 Then`. No helper function needed. Chosen.

**Decision**: Introduced `eExportFormatVersion` enum in `modConstants.bas` with packed-integer values, a `LATEST_EXPORT_FORMAT` constant, and an `ExportFormatVersion` Long property on `clsOptions`. The property participates in the existing `m_colOptions`/`CallByName` serialization loop, storing as an integer in `vcs-options.json`. The `Upgrade` method in `clsOptions` converts the loaded `Info.AddinVersion` string to a packed integer via `VersionToExportFormat()` so existing projects default to whatever format they were last exported with (e.g., 4.1.2 projects stay on 40102). New projects default to `LATEST_EXPORT_FORMAT`. Two behaviors are gated behind `>= EFV_5_0_0`: form viewport normalization in `clsSourceParser` and command bar position sanitization in `clsDbCommandBar`. Import remains fully backwards compatible — no gating needed on the import side.

For the UI notification, the main form (`frmVCSMain`) shows a clickable `lblFormatUpdate` label when `ExportFormatVersion < LATEST_EXPORT_FORMAT`, and the export log prints a blue note with the same message. No message boxes — the user upgrades at their convenience via the Options form. Form layout files (`.bas`) are not modified by the agent; controls are added manually in Access to avoid corrupting the binary form structure.

**What this rules out**: Export format changes can no longer be introduced without gating. Every future sanitization or structural change to exported source files must: (1) add an enum member like `EFV_5_1_0 = 50100`, (2) update `[_Last]`, (3) wrap the new behavior in `If Options.ExportFormatVersion >= EFV_5_1_0`. `LATEST_EXPORT_FORMAT` is derived automatically from `eExportFormatVersion.[_Last]`. This is the intended maintenance pattern. The `dblExportFormatVersion` parameter on `BuildJsonFile` in `modVCSUtility` is a separate, older concept for JSON schema versioning and is unrelated to this system. If the packed-integer scheme ever runs out of range (99 minor or 99 patch versions per major), the packing formula would need adjustment, but this is unlikely.

**Relevant files**:

- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/modConstants.bas` — `eExportFormatVersion` enum, `LATEST_EXPORT_FORMAT`
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsOptions.cls` — `ExportFormatVersion` property, default, `Upgrade` migration
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/modVCSUtility.bas` — `VersionToExportFormat()`, `ExportFormatToVersion()`
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsSourceParser.cls` — viewport normalization gated
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbCommandBar.cls` — position sanitization gated
- `Version Control.accda.src/forms/frmVCSOptions.cls` — combo box population logic
- `Version Control.accda.src/forms/frmVCSMain.cls` — format update notification
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/modImportExport.bas` — export log format version + upgrade note

## 2026-03-06 — ObjectDate caching for fast-save change detection

**Trigger**: After building a database from source, a subsequent "fast save" export re-exported every single object (e.g., all 3,673 queries in `sec.accdb`, taking ~1,600s). The existing `IsModified` logic compared `DateModified > ExportDate`, but every object received a fresh `DateModified` from Access during import, making all objects appear modified.

**Options explored**:

- **Keep `DateModified > ExportDate` and fix by updating `ExportDate` after build**: Would require a post-build export pass or index manipulation. Fragile — still uses a directional comparison that can't detect objects restored to an earlier date. Rejected.
- **Content hash comparison for all components**: Would catch every change accurately but is expensive — requires a full export (SaveAsText) of each object just to check, defeating the performance goal. Rejected for date-trackable components; already used by 14 other component types that lack reliable DateModified.
- **Store `ObjectDate` (the object's `DateModified` at export/import time) and compare with exact match (`<>`)**: Records the actual timestamp Access assigned. After a build, the stored ObjectDate matches the current DateModified for unmodified objects. Uses `<>` instead of `>` to also detect objects restored to earlier dates. Chosen.

**Decision**: Added `ObjectDate` field to `clsVCSIndexItem`, stored it in `clsVCSIndex.Update` from `cItem.DateModified`, loaded it in `clsVCSIndex.LoadItem`, and switched all 6 DateModified-based `IsModified` implementations to compare against `ObjectDate` instead of `ExportDate`. Forms and reports retain their secondary `OtherHash` (VBA code module hash) check since VBA edits don't always update `DateModified`. Backward compatible: missing `ObjectDate` in existing index entries defaults to `0`, which never matches a real `DateModified`, so objects are conservatively treated as modified until the first export stores the value.

**What this rules out**: The `ExportDate` field is no longer used for change detection in any component class (though it's still stored and used elsewhere, e.g., conflict detection in `IsExportConflict`). Future component classes that track `DateModified` should use `ObjectDate` for their `IsModified` logic, not `ExportDate`. If Access ever changes how `DateModified` behaves (e.g., sub-second precision, or changing it on compact/repair), the exact-match comparison may need revisiting.

**Relevant files**:

- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsVCSIndexItem.cls` — new `ObjectDate` field
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsVCSIndex.cls` — load/save ObjectDate
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbQuery.cls` — IsModified updated
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbMacro.cls` — IsModified updated
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbTableDef.cls` — IsModified updated
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbTableDataMacro.cls` — IsModified updated
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbForm.cls` — IsModified updated (keeps OtherHash)
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/clsDbReport.cls` — IsModified updated (keeps OtherHash)
- `Version Control.accda.src/modules/modImportExport.bas` — skip-count logging during fast save
