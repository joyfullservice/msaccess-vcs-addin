*NOTE:* None of these are required to use the add-in, but they are designed to allow for easier installation and use.

|Setting <img width = 175> |**Default** <p> *(Setting)*|Description
|-|:-:|:-
|**Trust Add-In Folder**|**Default: On**|During installation, the VCS Addin install folder will be added as a trusted location in Microsoft Access/Office. This allows Access to load the Add-In correctly in some protected setups, and will enable faster loading in others. The install location is `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\MSAccessVCS\`
|**Open after install to trust add-in file**|**Default: Off**|In some protected computing environments (I.e. Government, Banking), the Add-In must be opened from the install location to be properly trusted. This option will open the add-in file immediately after install, and give you the opportunity to trust the file.
